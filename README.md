# Predictive-Analytics
There are two experiential learning assignments in this repository

Problem Statement:
The following dataset credit.csv contains information about credit card debt for hundreds of customers. The response is balance (average credit card debt for each individual) and there are several quantitative predictors: age, cards (number of credit cards), education (years of education), income (in thousands of dollars), limit (credit limit), and rating (credit rating). You need carry out detailed Exploratory Data Analysis, create linear regression models based on the techniques you have learnt in the course and carry out detailed outlier and residual analysis. Also, comment on the bias variance trade off, that is, overfitting and under fitting aspect of the model created.

Income - income in thousands of dollars
Limit - credit limit
Rating - credit rating
Cards - number of credit cards
Age - Age of the customer
Education - years of education
Own - house ownership
Student - student status
Married - marital status
Region - East, West or South
Balance - average credit card debt for each individual

In this assignment, you are expected to carry out data exploration, extensive model selection process, model diagnostics and testing etc. A Machine Learning project is generally not linear but will consist broadly of the following major steps.
Define Problem
Prepare Data
Data understanding (EDA)
Model building
Evaluate
Improve Model
Report Results
